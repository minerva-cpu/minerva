# Minerva

## A 32-bit RISC-V soft processor

Minerva is a CPU core that currently implements the [RISC-V][1] RV32IM instruction set. Its microarchitecture is described in plain Python code using the [nMigen][2] toolbox.

### Quick start

Minerva currently requires Python 3.6+ and [nMigen][2] on its `master` branch.

    # generate verilog
    python setup.py develop
    python cli.py generate > minerva.v

    # run some tests
    python setup.py test
    python -m unittest test/test_cache.py

To use Minerva in its minimal configuration, you need to wire the following ports to `minerva_cpu`:

* `clk`
* `rst`
* `ibus__*`
* `dbus__*`
* `external_interrupt`
* `timer_interrupt`
* `software_interrupt`

### Features

The microarchitecture of Minerva is largely inspired by the [LatticeMico32][3] processor.

Minerva is pipelined on 6 stages:

1. **Address**
   The address of the next instruction is calculated and sent to the instruction cache.
2. **Fetch**
   The instruction is read from memory.
3. **Decode**
   The instruction is decoded, and operands are either fetched from the register file or bypassed from the pipeline. Branches are predicted by the static branch predictor.
4. **Execute**
   Simple instructions such as arithmetic and logical operations are completed at this stage.
5. **Memory**
   More complicated instructions such as loads, stores and shifts require a second execution stage.
6. **Writeback**
   Results produced by the instructions are written back to the register file.

The L1 data cache is coupled to a write buffer. Store transactions are in this case done to the write buffer instead of the data bus. This enables stores to proceed in one clock cycle if the buffer isn't full, without having to wait for the bus transaction to complete. Store transactions are then completed in the background as the write buffer gets emptied to the data bus.

### Configuration

The following parameters can be used to configure the Minerva core.
